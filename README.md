# README_Generator

## Description: 

- Welcome to a demonstration of what coding with node.js and javascript is capable of! 

- Using inquirer to present easy to understand questions to users that they can then easily answer using the git-bash terminal.

- To get started, ensure you have inquirer installed. Open up your git-bash terminal and type in 'npm i'.

- Simply type into the terminal 'node index.js' and you are presented with the first of a series of questions. 

- Upon answering your question, you will be automatically presented with the next question. These questions will be asking you general information needed to create a quality README.md file. 

- Once all questions have been answered, you will receive a notification saying 'Successfully created NewREADME.md!' 

- fs will then use the writeToFile() function to create a new README.md file ready for use complete with proper formatting and imagery. 

- Try it out!
